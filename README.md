This project implements a secure and seamless login system using an Arduino board and an RFID reader. The system eliminates the need for manual password entry by allowing users to log in simply by scanning an RFID tag. The Arduino remains connected to the computer and transmits the unique identifier (UID) of the scanned tag, granting access automatically upon verification.
